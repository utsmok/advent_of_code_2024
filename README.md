
# What's this?

This repo holds my work and (possible?) solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

# Tech stack

**Language**

  Python (3.12 for now)
  
**env manager**

  [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). If you're using Python without uv ITYOOL 2024 you're missing out on the best Python experience. 
  
**IDE**

  [marimo](https://marimo.io/) notebooks (and sometimes some VSCode). Notebooks are nice for these types of small problems, and marimo is quick, has a great interface, perfect integration with uv, and is a lot more dependable than jupyter notebooks. 
  Also, marimo files are also proper standalone python scripts, useful if I decide I do want to make a proper script for a problem after all, instead of doing it in a notebook.
  
**OS**

  Windows 11, not even using wsl! 
  
**Additional Libraries**

  as mentioned, marimo is the main one. Additionally, I'm using this AoC to try out the [pyparsing](https://pypi.org/project/pyparsing/) package. It's an oldie, but I have no experience with it! That's it for now, after day 1.
